Analyzing the Language of Food on Social Media
3:00 pm - 4:00 pm
11th Floor Large Conference Room [1135]

We investigate the predictive power behind the language of
food on social media. We collect a corpus of over three million
food-related posts from Twitter and demonstrate that many latent
population characteristics can be directly predicted from this data:
overweight rate, diabetes rate, political leaning, and home
geographical location of authors. For all tasks, our language-based
models significantly outperform the majority- class baselines.
Performance is further improved with more complex natural language
processing, such as topic modeling. We analyze which textual features
have most predictive power for these datasets, providing insight into
the connections between the language of food, geographic locale, and
community characteristics. Lastly, we design and implement an online
system for real-time query and visualization of the dataset.
Visualization tools, such as geo-referenced heatmaps,
semantics-preserving wordclouds and temporal histograms, allow us to
discover more complex, global patterns mirrored in the language of
food.
